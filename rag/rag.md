# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an architectural pattern in Generative AI that enhances a Large Language Model (LLM) by retrieving relevant external knowledge before generating a response.

**_Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI framework that combines information retrieval with text generation models like GPT to produce more accurate and up-to-date responses. Instead of relying only on pre-trained data like traditional language models, RAG fetches relevant documents from an external knowledge source before generating an answer._**

Instead of relying only on its pre-trained parameters, the model retrieves context from a knowledge base and then generates an answer grounded in that data.
