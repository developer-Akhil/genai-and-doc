**What is Agentic AI?**

Agentic AI refers to an AI paradigm in which a model is designed to act as an autonomous agent capable of planning, reasoning, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve a goal, rather than only responding to single prompts.\
Agentic AI is an AI system that can independently plan, decide, and execute actions across multiple steps, often by using tools, memory, and feedback loops, to accomplish a defined objective.

**How Agentic AI Works (Conceptually)**\
An agentic system typically follows this loop:
1. Perceive – Understand the user goal and environment
2. Plan – Break the goal into steps
3. Act – Execute actions (API calls, database queries, code execution, searches)
4. Observe – Evaluate the results
5. Reflect & Adjust – Modify the plan if needed
6. Complete – Deliver the final outcome
