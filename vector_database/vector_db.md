# Vector Database

A vector database stores embeddings and allows you to find the most semantically similar items using mathematical distance metrics.

A Vector Database is a specialized type of storage system designed to handle unstructured data (like text, images, and audio) by converting them into numerical arrays called vectors or embeddings.

Unlike traditional relational databases that store data in rows and columns and search for exact matches (e.g., "Find user ID 105"), a vector database finds data based on similarity or context.


**Common Examples**
If you are looking to implement one, the industry leaders currently include:\
* Pinecone (Managed/Cloud-native)
* Milvus (Open-source/Enterprise)
* Weaviate (Open-source/Graph-based)
* Chroma (Simple/Developer-friendly)
